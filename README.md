# 🐱 Natcat

**Master the Swiss Army Knife of Networking**

Natcat is an interactive educational platform designed to teach Netcat commands and networking concepts in a safe, browser-based environment. It features a fully functional terminal simulator, a quick-reference cheatsheet, and security-focused lessons.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Terminal Simulator**: A sandboxed shell environment that mimics a Linux terminal, allowing users to practice commands without risking their own network.
  - **Virtual File System**: Supports standard file operations like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, and `cat`.
  - **Networking Tools**: Simulates `nc` (Netcat), `ping`, `dig`, `whois`, `nmap`, and `curl`.
  - **Package Management**: Includes a simulated package manager (`pkg`) to install additional tools like `npm`.
  - **Fun Extras**: Includes `cowsay` and `figlet` for ASCII art.
- **Netcat Cheatsheet**: Instant access to common flags and command patterns for rapid reference.
- **Modern UI**: Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a responsive, dark-mode inspired design.
